Python for Data Science

It’s also interactive, object-oriented - Python 3

- first module: types, expressions, variables, strings and string operations.
- second :data structures, namely lists and tuples, sets and dictionaries.
Lists and tuples, are called compound data types and are one of the key types of data
structures in Python. Sets and dictionaries are types of collections.
- In the 3rd module we'll cover Python programming fundamentals, including conditions, branching,
loops, functions, and objects and classes. Specifically, you’ll learn about comparison
and logic operators, and the if, else, and elif statements, for and while loops, how
to use some of Python’s built-in functions, as well as how build your own functions, and
how to create objects and classes using object constructors and attributes.
- And finally, in the 4th module we'll show you how to work with data in Python.
Specifically, how to read and write with the open method, and how to load, work with, and
save data in pandas. 

 A statement or expression is an instruction
the computer will run or execute. 
The value in the parentheses is called the
argument.
If you are using a Jupiter notebook in this
course, you will see a small rectangle with the statement.
This is called a cell.
